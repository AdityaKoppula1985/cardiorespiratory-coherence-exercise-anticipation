# cardiorespiratory-coherence-exercise-anticipation
Model of human pacemaker cell and respiratory-autonomic modulation

# Pace folder:
The ion channel model files are stored in the folder Pace2

# scripts folder: 
scripts folder contains all the custom written python scripts to create a human pacemaker model cell and simulate the effect of exercise anticipation

script1: contains the code for sanity check analysis to evaluate the behavior of pacemaker model cell in response to a small subset of respiratroy-autonomic mechanims

script 2: conatins the code for full-space analysis where the effect of all 96 possible combinations of mechanisms from the following two sets:
respiratory variability set 1: ['rav','ravs','rrav','rrav2','rravs','rravs2','rrv','rrv2','rrvs','rrvs2','rs','sinusoidal']
Autonomic tone and sympathetic modulation set 2: ['AT','LT','BT','HT','SM','SM_BT','SM_LT','SM_HT']

script 3: contains code to extract best fit simulated conditions for each exercise condition in the CRC study

# crcsims1 & crcsims2 folder:
It contains the coherence data generated by script 2 that computes "cardiorespiratory" coherence simulated by all the 96 simulation conditions, and each condition is iterated 20 times.

# Data folder 
It conatins the average coherence data for the 11 exercise conditions and 96 simulation conditions
